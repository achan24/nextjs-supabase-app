Here’s the **updated, final version** of your text-based framework — no fluff, just the logic:

---

## 🧱 STRUCTURE: GOALS + LIFE SYSTEM FRAMEWORK

### 1. **Area**

* Broad category of life.
* Fixed set (e.g. 7 total).

### 2. **Subarea** (mandatory)

* Every goal belongs to a subarea.
* Subareas break down the Area into meaningful, trackable focuses.

---

### 3. **Goal**

* Outcome you want to achieve in a subarea.
* Can be long-term or short-term.
* Has associated milestones and metrics.

---

### 4. **Milestone**

* Concrete, trackable checkpoints on the way to a goal.
* Measured by metric thresholds (e.g., "hit 10 hours total", or "3 streak days").

---

### 5. **Metric**

* Numerical tracker (e.g., time spent, number of tasks, streaks).
* Connected to milestones and goals.
* Updated automatically via tasks.

---

### 6. **Task**

* Individual logged activity.
* Linked to one or more metrics.
* Logs time, date, and optional notes.

---

## 🔁 DATA FLOW (RELATIONAL)

```
Task → Metric(s) → Milestone(s) → Goal → Subarea → Area
```

Each level flows up. Tasks update metrics. Metrics update milestone progress. Milestones complete goals. Goals define progress in subareas. Subareas roll up into life areas.

## 🧩 EXAMPLE (FULL CHAIN)

* **Area:** Health & Fitness

  * **Subarea:** Sleep

    * **Goal:** Fix my sleep cycle

      * **Milestone:** Sleep before 11pm for 10 days

        * **Metric:** Nights slept before 11pm

          * **Task:** “In bed by 10:30” (logs metric value)

---

Awesome — here’s a solid set of **full chain examples** across your 7 Areas. Each includes:

```
Area → Subarea → Goal → Milestone → Metric → Task
```

These are concrete, ADHD-friendly, and immediately actionable.

## 🔄 PROCESS TIMER ENHANCEMENTS

To better integrate the process timer with this goals framework, here are suggested improvements:

### 1. Sequence-Based Metric Integration
* Link sequences (not individual tasks) to specific metrics
* Each sequence completion contributes to its linked metrics:
  * Total sequence duration
  * Completion count
  * Completion streaks
* Track and display:
  * Cumulative time across sequence runs
  * Sequence completion patterns
  * Performance trends over time
* Show real-time metric progress during sequence execution

### 2. Milestone Connections
* Associate sequences with specific milestones
* Sequence completions automatically update milestone progress
* Show milestone context in sequence UI:
  * Progress towards milestone thresholds
  * Number of sequence runs needed
  * Projected completion date based on current pace
* Group sequences by milestone for focused progress

### 3. Goal Context
* Organize sequences under specific goals
* Display goal progress while executing related sequences
* Track sequence contribution to goal metrics
* Show goal velocity and projected completion dates
* Highlight how current sequence fits into goal strategy

### 4. Area Organization
* Categorize sequences by life areas and subareas
* Area-level dashboards showing:
  * Active sequences
  * Recent completions
  * Time distribution
  * Progress across subareas
* Filter and group sequence history by area/subarea

### 5. Smart Sequence Suggestions
* Recommend sequences based on:
  * Goal priorities
  * Milestone deadlines
  * Historical patterns
  * Available time slots
* Suggest sequence modifications for better goal alignment
* Identify high-impact sequences for specific goals

### 6. Progress Visualization
* Visual progress indicators for:
  * Sequence-based metrics
  * Milestone completion
  * Goal advancement
  * Area balance
* Timeline views showing sequence contributions to objectives
* Sequence performance analytics and trends

### 7. Adaptive Sequence Timing
* Adjust sequence estimates based on:
  * Goal deadlines
  * Milestone targets
  * Historical performance
  * Current progress rate
* Optimize sequence scheduling for goal timelines
* Suggest sequence frequency adjustments based on goal needs

This integration would transform the timer from a task-execution tool into a goal-driven sequence management system, maintaining simplicity while providing meaningful metric contributions through complete process sequences.
