  ```sql
  -- Tasks table
  create table tasks (
    id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
    user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
    title text not null,
    description text,
    priority integer, -- 1-5
    status text not null default 'pending', -- pending, in_progress, completed
    due_date timestamp with time zone,
    created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
  );

  -- Projects table (for grouping tasks)
  create table projects (
    id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
    user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
    title text not null,
    description text,
    priority integer, -- 1-5
    created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
  );

  -- Task-Project relationship
  create table task_projects (
    task_id uuid references tasks(id) on delete cascade,
    project_id uuid references projects(id) on delete cascade,
    primary key (task_id, project_id)
  );

  -- Enable RLS
  alter table tasks enable row level security;
  alter table projects enable row level security;
  alter table task_projects enable row level security;

  -- RLS Policies
  create policy "Users can view own tasks" on tasks
    for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
  create policy "Users can create own tasks" on tasks
    for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
  create policy "Users can update own tasks" on tasks
    for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
  create policy "Users can delete own tasks" on tasks
    for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

  -- Similar policies for projects and task_projects...
