## 3. Civilization-Style Advisor System (NEW IDEA)
**Status**: ðŸ’¡ Conceptual

### Concept
Inspired by Civilization games, where each area of your life has a specialized advisor, with an overall advisor making final decisions.

#### Area-Specific Advisors
Each life area (from GOAL system) gets its own AI advisor:

1. **Work & Learning Advisor**
   - Specializes in career development, skill building, education
   - Knows about your learning patterns, work preferences
   - Advises on professional growth and knowledge acquisition

2. **Health & Fitness Advisor**
   - Focuses on physical health, exercise, nutrition, sleep
   - Tracks health metrics and provides personalized recommendations
   - Advises on sustainable health habits

3. **Relationships Advisor**
   - Manages social connections, family, friendships
   - Reminds about important dates, relationship maintenance
   - Advises on communication and social skills

4. **Environment & Hygiene Advisor**
   - Focuses on living space, organization, cleanliness
   - Helps with home management and environmental factors
   - Advises on creating supportive physical environments

5. **Finances Advisor**
   - Manages budgeting, saving, financial planning
   - Tracks spending patterns and financial goals
   - Advises on money management and financial literacy

6. **Mental Health & Reflection Advisor**
   - Focuses on emotional well-being, stress management
   - Provides mindfulness and self-reflection guidance
   - Advises on mental health maintenance

7. **Play & Hobbies Advisor**
   - Manages leisure activities, creative pursuits, fun
   - Ensures work-life balance and enjoyment
   - Advises on recreational activities and stress relief

#### Overall Advisor (Chief Advisor)
- **Role**: Makes final decisions and coordinates all area advisors
- **Function**: 
  - Receives input from all area advisors
  - Weighs competing priorities
  - Makes final recommendations
  - Hands off tasks to Personal Assistant for execution
- **Decision Making**: Considers user's overall goals, current energy levels, and life balance

#### Personal Assistant
- **Role**: Executes the Chief Advisor's decisions
- **Function**:
  - Creates tasks and reminders
  - Schedules activities
  - Sends notifications
  - Manages day-to-day logistics

### How It Works
1. **Area Advisors** analyze their specific domains
2. **Chief Advisor** receives all recommendations and makes final decisions
3. **Personal Assistant** executes the decisions and manages logistics
4. **User** receives coordinated, prioritized advice and actions

### Example Flow
```
Work Advisor: "User needs to prepare for tomorrow's presentation"
Health Advisor: "User hasn't exercised in 3 days"
Relationships Advisor: "User's mom's birthday is this weekend"

Chief Advisor: "Based on priorities, let's focus on the presentation today, 
schedule a quick workout, and remind about the birthday gift."

Personal Assistant: "Created: 1) Presentation prep task (high priority), 
2) 20-min workout reminder, 3) Birthday gift reminder"
```
