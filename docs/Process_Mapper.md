# Process Mapper - Real-Time Sequence Creation

## Overview

The Process Mapper is a dynamic interface that allows users to create sequences "on the fly" as they actually perform tasks, capturing both the process steps and timing data in real-time, then saving it as a proper sequence for future reference and optimization.

## Core Concept

A fluid, real-time process capture system that combines:
- **Process Flow** creation and visualization
- **Process Timer** sequence building
- **Task** creation and management
- **Decision point** tracking and branching
- **Time tracking** and analytics

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Process Capture
- Start a session and begin recording your process
- Document steps as you complete them
- Add notes, timers, and context in real-time
- End session and save as a complete sequence

### 2. Decision Points & Conditional Branching
- Capture decision points when signals, events, or circumstances arise
- Record different paths based on conditions
- Track decision reasoning and outcomes
- Build complex, realistic process flows

### 3. Flexible Content Support
- **Academic**: Research processes, study methods, writing workflows
- **Professional**: Work processes, project management, skill development
- **Social**: Interaction patterns, networking, relationship building
- **Personal**: Daily routines, habit formation, life optimization
- **Creative**: Design processes, content creation, problem-solving

## Workflow

### Session Flow
```
Start Session → Perform Work → Document Steps → Make Decisions → End Session → Save Sequence → Optionally Move to Process Flow
```

### Data Flow
```
Process Mapper Session → Create Tasks in Temp Map → Build Sequence → Save to Process Timer → Optionally Move to Proper Process Flow
```

  eventType: 'bottleneck' | 'breakthrough' | 'decision' | 'error' | 'milestone';
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  relativeTime: number; // seconds from session start
  context: {
    trigger: string;
    outcome: string;
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  };
  predicted: boolean; // whether this was predicted
  accuracy?: number; // how close prediction was to actual timing
}

interface EventPrediction {
  id: string;
  eventType: string;
  predictedTime: number; // seconds from session start
  confidence: number; // 0-1 probability
  historicalOccurrences: number;
  averageTiming: number;
  standardDeviation: number;
