My initial prompt:  I'm creating a kind of character avatar page where I can see the stats of my character, but it's part of a larger app called guardian angel which has tasks built in, areas>subareas>goals and metrics, and sequences which are a number of tasks arranged sequentially.
So I kind of want to map these tasks and goals and stuff to my virtual avatar.  I could use tags to tag certain tasks or goals, etc to contribute to certain skills or character values, eg. discipline, strength, perseverance, etc.  
Think of the sims, my character is a virtual representation of me, except in sims where you just spend time skilling up cooking for example, there would be corresponding goals or maybe there should be a separate skills category where I focus specifically on building skills, that could be separate from goals.  Because thinking about it goals are emphemeral, once they are completed they are done, so to speak, but skills - you can always improve skills, so I like the idea of skills building rather than goals, you can swap your goals, etc but you always want certain skills, like social skills, maybe cooking skills, maybe life management skills, skills are what differentiate us and ability to execute.  That's what learning is.  That's the point of this app.



Awesome. Let's break this down into a clear MVP spec so you can build this character dashboard inside your Guardian Angel app.

🧍‍♂️ CHARACTER PAGE — SPECIFICATION

🔹 1. GOAL
To create a dynamic, gamified profile page that:

Shows your daily progress across core life areas
Visually reflects how well you're doing
Motivates habit-building and long-term progression
🔹 2. CORE COMPONENTS
🧠 A. Avatar State Logic

Predefined avatar states based on overall bar fill %
Visual layers tied to area states (e.g., messy room for low environment)
Avatar expression + background reflect status:
80–100%: 🟢 Clean, confident, bright
50–79%: 🟡 Neutral, okay
<50%: 🔴 Messy, tired, dim
📊 B. Progress Bars (Daily Fill)

Each area has a target and a current progress:

Area	Daily Target (pts)	Source
Work & Learning	5 pts	Tagged tasks/sequences
Health & Fitness	3 pts	Exercise, movement logs
Relationships	1–2 pts	Messages, calls, hangs
Environment & Hygiene	2 pts	Cleaning, grooming logs
Mind & Spirit (opt)	1 pt	Meditation, journaling
Bar = (points completed / daily target) * 100%

🕓 C. Streaks & Momentum

Show current streak days
Progression meter: track area level-ups based on consistent success
📝 D. Daily Task Log Feed (optional)

Show last 5–10 completed tasks with timestamps


🔹 5. SCALING + PROGRESSION SYSTEM
Daily quota grows over time if you consistently hit targets
You can optionally manually increase difficulty
Later: add XP gain per area, skill levels, and passive buffs


🔹 6. ASSET SYSTEM (for Avatar)
Use:

SVG layers (hair, background, expression, clothing, cleanliness, etc.)
Or just switch between static pre-rendered images for now
Logic can be like:

if (hygiene < 50) show 'greasy hair'
if (environment < 50) show 'messy background'
if (overallScore > 80) show 'smiling expression'




You're not just making a task manager — you're building a life simulation game starring you.
Let's break this down into systems to help you build it piece by piece, starting with a daily structure, visual feedback, and progression model.

🎮 THE CORE LOOP: "LIVE A GOOD DAY"

Every day is a level. To beat it, you must:

Complete core tasks across all areas
Fill your life bars (Hygiene, Fitness, Work, etc.)
See your avatar reflect how you're doing
Progress to harder/more meaningful days over time
✅ DAILY STRUCTURE — "The Checklist of Life"

🎯 Step 1: Daily Requirements System
Each day has a required quota per area:

Area	Required Today
Hygiene	🧼 Shower + brush teeth (2 pts)
Health & Fitness	🏃 30m movement or workout (3 pts)
Work & Learning	💻 1–2 hours of deep work (5 pts)
Relationships	📞 1 meaningful interaction (1 pt)
Environment	🧹 Tidy + 1 chore (2 pts)
Mind/Spirit (optional)	🧘 Meditate or journal (1 pt)
You can start small and scale over time.

📈 SCALING DIFFICULTY OVER TIME

Track your success over a rolling 7-day window.

If you meet daily targets consistently → level up that area
Then you increase that area's daily quota slightly
If you fail too often → the area "decays" a bit
This builds a progressive life engine:

You don't start with 10 tasks/day
But 3 weeks from now, you might handle 15 with ease
🧍 AVATAR REFLECTION SYSTEM

🌞 If you're doing well:
Avatar looks clean, sharp, confident
Background is tidy, sunny, well-kept
😵 If you slack:
Hair messy, dark circles under eyes
Clothes wrinkled, room gets cluttered
Eventually: sitting on couch looking lifeless
🎨 Implementation
Avatar states can be pre-rendered images or SVG layer combos
Every area has a "clean" and "dirty" state:
Hygiene: shiny vs. greasy
Environment: tidy room vs. clutter
Fitness: upright posture vs. slouched
You can blend these together to form unique states (just like Sims or Tamagotchi).

📊 VISUAL SYSTEM

Component	Details
Life Bars	Daily area quotas (fill % shown with color or animation)
Avatar Renderer	Switches images based on area fill % thresholds
Progress Tracker	Weekly level-up tracker
Penalty Tracker	Decay effects if <40% over 3 days
Streak Meter	Visual badge or aura around avatar (e.g., glowing if on fire 🔥)


👇 Example User Flow

Morning: Avatar looks tired, house slightly messy.
User completes:
Shower 🧼 (hygiene +1)
Cleans desk 🧹 (environment +1)
Starts work (work +2)
Bars fill → avatar animates: brighter eyes, clothes freshen
By evening:
If all bars full → avatar fully restored, maybe with glow or badge
If only some → mixed appearance (fresh, but messy room)

# Character Attribute Definitions

# NEW FEATURE: Daily Target Completion UI (2024-06-18)

🎯 GOAL
To reduce visual clutter and increase focus by hiding completed areas/subareas/goals for the current day.

📋 REQUIREMENTS

1. Completion Criteria
   - An area is considered "complete" when its daily_points >= daily_target
   - A subarea is considered "complete" when its daily_points >= daily_target
   - A goal is considered "complete" when its daily_points >= daily_target

2. UI Behavior
   - When an area/subarea/goal reaches its daily target:
     - The item smoothly fades out (animation)
     - A small "completed" indicator appears briefly before fade
     - The item is hidden from the main view
   
3. Access to Hidden Items
   - Add a "Show Completed" toggle button at the top of the list
   - When toggled ON:
     - Show all items, with completed ones having a visual distinction (e.g., checkmark, opacity)
     - Keep the completed items at the bottom of the list
   - When toggled OFF:
     - Hide completed items
     - Show only items still needing work

4. Persistence
   - The hidden state resets at midnight (when daily points reset)
   - The user's toggle preference (show/hide completed) should persist across sessions

5. Edge Cases
   - If a completed item's points are reduced below target:
     - Item should smoothly fade back in
     - Item should return to its original position in the list
   - Parent items (areas/subareas) should remain visible if they have incomplete children
   - Empty state: Show encouraging message when all items are complete

6. Technical Considerations
   - Use CSS transitions for smooth animations
   - Store toggle state in localStorage
   - Update points calculations to trigger visibility changes
   - Maintain proper spacing/layout when items are hidden

7. Accessibility
   - Toggle button should be keyboard accessible
   - Screen readers should announce when items are completed
   - Hidden items should still be in the DOM but visually hidden

This feature aims to help users focus on remaining tasks while maintaining access to completed items when needed.

**Discipline**: Doing tasks you've done before. Sticking to routines, habits, or familiar actions.

**Courage**: Doing tasks you've never done before. Attempting something new or unknown, where you don't know how you'll perform.

**Bravery**: Doing things you know you suck at, but do them anyway. Facing tasks you've tried and struggled with, or know are difficult for you, and still taking action.

**Creativity**: Thinking of new tasks that work—i.e., are effective. Coming up with novel solutions or approaches that prove to be successful in practice.

# Secondary Character Traits

**Resilience**: Bouncing back after setbacks, failures, or tough days.

# System Implementation & Conversation Summary (2024-06)

This section summarizes the design, logic, and implementation details discussed and refined during the development of the gamified character and goal-tracking system.

---

### 1. Weekly Targets System
- **Database:** Created a `character_weekly_targets` table, ensuring correct RLS policies and UUID usage.
- **Frontend:** Implemented loading and saving of weekly targets, fixed UUID mapping, and ensured error handling and type safety.
- **Bugs Fixed:** Addressed issues with saving/loading, UUID mismatches, and RLS errors. Added toast notifications for save success/failure.
- **UI/UX:** Added accessibility improvements, loading spinners, and error messages for authentication and state loading.

### 2. Authentication and Supabase Client
- Ensured the correct Supabase client (`@/lib/supabase`) is used throughout for consistent authentication and cookie management.
- Fixed issues with user ID retrieval and state loading.

### 3. Dialog Accessibility and Controlled Inputs
- Addressed warnings about missing `aria-describedby` in dialogs.
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings by ensuring all input values are always defined.

### 4. Weekly/Daily Target Logic
- Clarified the distinction between "Today's Targets" (saving/loading only today's values) and "Weekly Schedule" (saving/loading all days).
- Updated logic so that saving from each tab only affects the intended days.
- Ensured that editing in either tab updates the correct part of the weekly targets array.

### 5. Data Propagation and State Sync
- Fixed issues where changes in the dialog were not reflected in the main "Daily Progress" UI.
- Added a new prop (`onUpdateAllTargets`) to propagate all weekly targets back to the parent, updating area, subarea, and goal targets for today.

### 6. Trait Definitions and Tagging System
- Defined primary traits: **Discipline** (routine tasks), **Courage** (new tasks), **Bravery** (tasks you know you struggle with), **Creativity** (new, effective tasks).
- Defined secondary traits: **Resilience, Adaptability, Initiative, Perseverance, Self-Awareness, Empathy, Patience, Accountability, Resourcefulness, Curiosity**.
- For each trait, provided:
  - A definition
  - Example tasks
  - Tagging/categorical rules (suggested tags, rules for automatic/manual tagging, and examples)
- Added all definitions and rules to this document.

### 7. XP and Stat System
- Outlined the flow: Completing a task/sequence attached to a goal contributes points to daily progress and awards XP.
- Tags on tasks boost character stats and can apply XP multipliers.
- **Multipliers:** Courage = x2 XP, Bravery = x3 XP (highest multiplier applies if both are present).
- Provided logic for how to apply these multipliers and how to increment stats based on tags.

### 8. User Clarifications and Philosophy
- User clarified nuanced distinctions between traits (e.g., discipline vs. courage vs. bravery).
- Discussed how to recognize and tag tasks for each trait, both automatically and manually.
- Emphasized the importance of accurate state propagation and correct UI reflection of saved data.

### 9. Outstanding Issues and Fixes
- Fixed issues with only area-level targets being saved/loaded; ensured subarea and goal targets are included.
- Ensured that saving from the correct tab (daily/weekly) only affects the intended days.
- Ensured that all relevant state is updated in the parent component after dialog actions.

---

**In summary:**
The system now supports nuanced trait tracking, correct data flow, and extensible tagging for both primary and secondary character attributes. The documentation and codebase reflect a full-stack approach: database schema, frontend state management, accessibility, error handling, trait definitions, tagging logic, XP/stat calculation, and extensibility for future features.

## Task/Sequence Completion Flow

1. **Complete a Task or Sequence**
   - The task/sequence is attached to a goal (and possibly to an area/subarea).

2. **Points Contribution**
   - The task's points contribute to the relevant daily progress target (area, subarea, or goal).
   - This helps fill the progress bar for that day.

3. **XP Award**
   - Completing the task/sequence gives you XP.
   - The amount of XP can be based on:
     - The base points of the task/sequence.
     - Any multipliers from tags (see below).

4. **Tag-Based Stat Boosts**
   - The tags on the task (e.g., `discipline`, `courage`, `creativity`, etc.) boost your character's corresponding stats.
   - For example:
     - Completing a "courage" task increases your Courage stat.
     - Completing a "discipline" task increases your Discipline stat.
     - Completing a "creativity" task increases your Creativity stat.
   - Secondary tags (e.g., `resilience`, `adaptability`) can boost those secondary stats.

5. **Daily Progress**
   - As you complete tasks, your daily progress bars fill up for each area.
   - When you hit your daily targets, you can get bonus XP or rewards.

---

## Example Flow

- You complete a task tagged as `courage`, `creativity`, and worth 2 points, attached to the "Work & Learning" goal.
- **Points:**  
  - 2 points are added to your "Work & Learning" daily progress.
- **XP:**  
  - You get base XP for the task (e.g., 2 XP), plus a bonus for the tags (e.g., +1 XP for each tag).
- **Stats:**  
  - Your Courage and Creativity stats each increase by 1.
- **Daily Progress:**  
  - If you reach your daily target for "Work & Learning", you get a daily bonus.

---

## How to Implement

- When a task/sequence is completed:
  1. Add its points to the relevant progress target(s).
  2. Award XP (base + tag bonuses).
  3. Increment the stats for each tag present.
  4. Check if daily targets are met for bonus XP.
