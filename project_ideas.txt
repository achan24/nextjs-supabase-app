ADHD Task Management System
==================================

Core Concept:
A minimalist task management system designed for ADHD users, featuring AI assistance that understands ADHD patterns and adapts to user behavior.

Key Features:

1. Project & Priority Management
   - Simple list of projects with dynamic priorities (1-5)
   - Weekly priority check-ins ("What's your focus this week?")
   - AI monitoring and suggestions for priority adjustments
   - Maximum of 3 high-priority projects at a time

2. Habit Building
   - Track daily working time
   - Progressive goals (start small, increment gradually)
   - AI-assisted streak tracking and motivation
   - Pattern recognition for optimal work times

3. AI Assistant Capabilities
   - Access to project data, habits, and working patterns
   - Can create/edit projects and tasks with user confirmation
   - Monitors working time and suggests breaks
   - Provides ADHD-specific coping strategies
   - Weekly reviews and priority suggestions
   - Learns from user behavior and success patterns

4. Time Management
   - Daily working time targets
   - AI-adjusted goals based on energy levels
   - Automatic tracking of actual vs. target time
   - Gradual increase in daily targets

Data Structure:
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  priority: number;
  timeSpent: number;
  lastWorkedOn: Date;
  aiNotes: string[]; // AI observations and suggestions
}

interface WorkSession {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  energyLevel: number;
  focusRating: number;
  aiAnalysis: {
    patterns: string[];
    suggestions: string[];
  };
}

interface AIAssistant {
  createProject(project: Project): Promise<boolean>;
  editProject(id: string, changes: Partial<Project>): Promise<boolean>;
  analyzePriorities(): Promise<PriorityRecommendation[]>;
  suggestNextTask(): Promise<TaskSuggestion>;
  reviewProgress(): Promise<ProgressReport>;
}
```

Progressive Implementation:
1. Week 1-2: Basic time tracking + AI observation
2. Week 3-4: Project management + AI suggestions
3. Week 5-6: Habit tracking + AI pattern recognition
4. Week 7+: Full AI assistance and adaptations

AI Learning Focus:
- User's peak productivity times
- Project success patterns
- Common obstacles and effective solutions
- Individual ADHD manifestation patterns
- Effective motivation strategies

Future Enhancements:
- Integration with calendar
- Voice interface for AI interaction
- Mood and energy tracking
- Medication reminder system (if applicable)
- Export of AI insights for healthcare providers
